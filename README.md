### Context

Legends of Runeterra is a 2020 digital collectible card game developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by the physical collectible card game Magic: The Gathering, the developers sought to create a game within the same genre that significantly lowered the barrier to entry. 
Like other collectible card games, players play one versus one to reduce their opponent's health, which is 20, to zero. Cards come in a variety of types and belong to one to two of ten regionsâ€”groups of cards with a similar gameplay identity. One significant feature is the game's combat pacing; unlike in other collectible card games, each player alternates between attacking and defending every turn. 

Legends of Runeterra has been well-received by critics, who point to its generous progression systems, accessible gameplay, and high-quality visuals, and has won several industry awards.
